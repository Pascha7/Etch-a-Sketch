# Etch-a-Sketch-

As I embark on this project to create a browser version of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, I am filled with excitement and anticipation. This undertaking is designed to challenge my skills in DOM manipulation, pushing me to expand my knowledge and abilities in web development.

Through this project, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript methods and CSS techniques. I expect to encounter obstacles along the way, but that is part of the learning process. I am prepared to embrace the challenges and use them as opportunities for growth.

By building this toy for my portfolio, I aim to showcase my proficiency in creating interactive web applications. I understand that this project will require me to frequently search for solutions and learn new concepts that may not have been covered in my previous studies. This aspect excites me because it provides a chance to explore and discover the vast resources available on the internet.

Ultimately, this project is not meant to be easy. I am fully aware that I will need to invest time and effort to achieve the desired outcome. However, I am confident that the skills and knowledge I will gain from this experience will greatly enhance my abilities as a web developer.

With determination and a willingness to learn, I am eager to embark on this journey of creating a captivating sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch browser version. I look forward to overcoming challenges, honing my skills, and proudly adding this project to my portfolio as a testament to my growth and dedication.
